run.py search in calculation only closer to `pi pi*pi or pi**1/2` values.
run.py only polished enough.
Later , using html generator is possible to test matrices with best result indices, using maxima runme.wxm file and batchStuff.txt , generated using html miniapp. Generated numbers of html matrices same as matrices numbers in python code.

not use this, not polished finally.
runfull.py print each group of results of matrices calculation in files.

Trying to make python checker and printer fail, code very muddy, and just trunscoded from javascript html generator to be similar/comparable with wxmaxima stuff.
